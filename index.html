        <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the begining element, never the closing element. </li>
        <li>The title, style, base, link, meta, and script metadata tags can be used inside the head element.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>Elements nested inside the body element are known as child elements</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>There are three ways to stile a webpage using CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS Style Sheet, and External CSS Style Sheet.</li>
            <li>Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in an HTML file. This is used to style a particular page element only.</li>
            <li>Internal CSS Style Sheet, contains CSS rules for a webpage in the heading section of the HTML file. This is used to style multiple elements in th page code. </li>
            <li>Exernal CSS Style Sheet, allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components: The CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          </ul>
